Cows are domesticated mammals that are commonly raised for their meat, milk, and hides. They belong to the Bovidae family and are known for their large size, distinctive horns, and gentle demeanor. Cows are herbivorous animals that graze on grass, hay, and other vegetation. They have a complex digestive system that enables them to extract nutrients from tough plant material through a process called rumination. Cows are social animals that form close bonds with other members of their herd and have a complex communication system that involves various vocalizations and body language. In many cultures, cows are considered sacred animals and are revered for their contributions to human society.
